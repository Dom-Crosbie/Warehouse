# Warehouse Space Management API

## Overview

The Warehouse Space Management API is a RESTful service designed to streamline the management of warehouse facilities and their operational status. This API provides comprehensive functionality for tracking, managing, and optimizing warehouse space utilization across multiple locations.

## Purpose

This API serves as a centralized solution for:

- **Warehouse Space Tracking**: Monitor and manage warehouse facilities with detailed location and capacity information
- **Operational Status Management**: Track the current status of warehouse spaces (available, occupied, maintenance)
- **Inventory Space Optimization**: Enable efficient allocation and utilization of warehouse storage capacity
- **Facility Operations**: Support warehouse management teams with real-time facility data

## Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Centralized Management**: Provide a single source of truth for all warehouse space information
2. **Real-time Visibility**: Enable real-time tracking of warehouse space availability and status
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline warehouse operations through automated space management
4. **Scalability**: Support growing warehouse networks with flexible and extensible architecture

### Business Benefits

- **Improved Space Utilization**: Maximize warehouse capacity through better visibility and planning
- **Reduced Operational Costs**: Minimize idle space and optimize resource allocation
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Provide data-driven insights for warehouse planning and management
- **Streamlined Operations**: Automate routine warehouse space management tasks

## API Features

### Core Functionality

- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for warehouse spaces
- **Space Filtering**: Query warehouse spaces by various criteria
- **Status Management**: Track and update warehouse operational status
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity with comprehensive input validation

### Supported Operations

| Operation | Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/warehouses` | Retrieve all warehouse spaces |
| POST | `/warehouses` | Create a new warehouse space |
| GET | `/warehouses/{id}` | Get specific warehouse by ID |
| PUT | `/warehouses/{id}` | Update existing warehouse |
| DELETE | `/warehouses/{id}` | Remove warehouse space |

### Data Model

Each warehouse space includes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Warehouse facility name
- **Location**: Geographic or address location
- **Size**: Storage capacity (square footage or similar metric)
- **Status**: Current operational state
  - `available`: Ready for use
  - `occupied`: Currently in use
  - `maintenance`: Under maintenance or repair

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability:

- Request limits are enforced per time window
- Rate limit information is provided in response headers
- Detailed error responses when limits are exceeded
